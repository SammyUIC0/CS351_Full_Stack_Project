# Timeline: Weekly Meeting Goals  

**Q2:** What is your goals that your group want to achieve in each weekly meeting?  
**Example:**  
*Prior to 3/13: Weekly Meeting we will plan out some preliminary info/idea for the project itself ahead of the scheduled meeting like which data source/API and data structures we will use in our backend. We will browse [the given list of public APIs for inspiration](https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis).*  

*During week of 3/25: Work on the project rough draft itself to make a functioning project with data input, data structure usage, and processing into output on the frontend.*  

*Prior to 4/17: Meet together weekly to target project weakpoints/bugs and possibly visit office hours to get guidance if the progress feels weak.*  


**Answer**  
  
**Week of 9/22** – Hold an initial group meeting for introductions. Ensure all members have access to the GitHub repo and Figma collaboration space. Brainstorm project ideas (leaning toward Track 3 “Culture Guesser”). Split work to answer the MS2 questions in the README.  

**Prior to 10/02 (MS2 deadline)** – Meet at least once more to finalize group roles, confirm the project idea and scope, and complete/push all required MS2 questions to the GitHub repo (including extra credit).  

**Prior to MS4 Due Date** – Continue holding weekly meetings to check progress, surface and resolve bugs, and ensure everyone is aligned on responsibilities. Adjust timelines and redistribute tasks as needed.

# Norms  

**Q4a:** How will your group handle situations when there is conflict in your group?  
**Answer:**
If a conflict arises for any reason, the first step is for each of us to take
turns during our meeting and respectfully explain our perspectives on the
situation in order to make sure we understand where each of us is coming from.
Then we can try to break down what happened and ask clarifying questions to
make sure we are all on the same page, and then from there we can try to figure
out a plan for how we can resolve the issue we are conflicted over.

Some helpful strategies to focus on include:
- Agreeing on roles and responsibilities, general and specific
- Making compromises on or dividing up work to acommodate the situation
- Preventing conflicts early on by setting clear goals for each group member and splitting work as evenly and consistently as possible

If the conflict hasn't yet been resolved after trying these strategies and a due date is approaching, we can bring it to a TA and explain the problem in a professional manner, and then use their advice as a plan to hopefully resolve the conflict in time for the deadline.

**Q4b:** How will your group handle situations when a member is not contributing enough?  

**Example:**  
*If there is a disagreement on direction, we will resolve it with a unanimous vote.*  
*If team members do not pull their weight, the team will politely remind them of their duties.*  
*If they continue to not pull their weight, then they will get another warning and a chance to start being more productive.*  

**Answer:**
The first and most effective approach would be any attempts to prevent this
from happening, such as checking in early with each other, and if a groupmate
seems to be falling behind on their task then the other groupmates can ask
what's wrong and if there's anything they can do to help or a way to change
responsibilites to better suit each other's needs.

It's important that when assigning group roles we are as specific as possible
about what exactly each person is implementing, rather than referring to our
roles as "backend" or "frontend".

If after this someone is still falling behind, we shouldn't assume laziness and
should ask what happened first. It's important to have a direct but respectfully
group conversation in order to channel strong communication between all group
members, and to stay factual and keep the conversation about work and fairness
instead of making anything personal.

Finally if this still hasn't worked to catch the person up to speed, bringing
in a TA can help to gain extra clarity and bring in a neutral-party's support
on the situation. This can help to solidify responsibilities between group
members, and to fairly and respecfully pressure any group member who has fallen
behind to catch up by better allowing them to understand their own
goals/responsibilites.

# Roles  

**Q5:** How will your group divide your role in the Group Project?  

**Example:**  
*Mauricio - Backend, Justin - Project Lead, Claudia - Frontend.*  

**Answer**  

**Conor — Backend 1 (Database & Functions)** – Designs and manages the database schema, implements backend functions, and ensures data is stored and retrieved correctly.  

**Sammy — Backend 2 (API to Frontend)** – Builds and documents the API endpoints, integrates backend logic into accessible routes, and ensures smooth data flow to the frontend.  

**Arsalan — Frontend 1 (Design)** – Leads UI/UX design and implementation, creates React components based on Figma designs, and ensures the app is user-friendly and visually consistent.  

**Eric — Frontend 2 (API to Backend)** – Connects the frontend to backend APIs, handles data fetching/state management, and renders API responses into the user interface.  

**Note:** As mentioned in Question 4, our roles will extend beyond the typical front-end/back-end split, and each member will take on responsibilities that support the entire stack when necessary and roles are subject to change if necessary.

# Tech Stacks

**Q6:** Which tech stacks will your group use? (Django + React)

---
# Full Stack Group Project Track  
---

# Track 1: Tackling Generative AI Consequences

**Problem 1:** AI podcasts are an increasingly large problem on platforms like Spotify,Youtube, and Apple Podcasts, as AI voice generation is significantly cheaper than AI generated video or AI 'Deepfakes'. These podcasts represent a new and dangerous vector for misinformation.

**Solution 1:** 
A website that compiles a list of known AI Podcast accounts throughout the big podcast streamers (Spotify, Youtube, Apple Podcasts, ect.).   

---

# Track 2: Technology for Public Goods 

**Problem 2:** 
UIC is a large commuter school were thousands of students make the same commute by car during roughly the same times. Often these students have little choice but to commute this way if they live out of the way from the MTA/CTA. This is inefficient, expensive and taxing to the enviroment.  


**Solution 2:** 
Create a carpooling website where students looking to carpool to campus can find other students to carpool with. Riders post thier desired routes and times, while Drivers set thier gas split and choose who they want to commute with. This creates a third option to commuting to campus that is cheaper and more enviromentally friendly than driving by yourself. Only UIC students and UIC emails are allowed to make accounts on the website. 


**Problem 3:**  
On a large campus like UIC or in busy public areas, students and community members frequently lose personal belongings, and there is no simple, centralized system for reporting and recovering lost items. Bulletin boards, social media groups, or word-of-mouth are inconsistent and usually ineffective, leaving many items permanently lost.  

**Solution 3:**  
A Lost & Found web app where users can post lost items with descriptions and photos, and others can report found items in the same centralized system. Items are searchable by keywords, categories, and date/location of loss. The platform would help reduce frustration and save time by connecting people who lose belongings with those who find them.  

# Track 3: Creative Coding and Cultural Expression

**Idea - Story - Inspiration 4:**
A website featuring a "guessr" game (inspired from games like geoguessr and
foodguessr) where the user is prompted with photos of events featured in UIC
cultural centers, and the goal is to guess the names of as many cultural events
featured on screen as possible, and after each guess, the answer is revealed
along with a detailed expository about the currently featured cultural event.
This genre of online games consistently finds positive reception online, is
relatively simple in concept, and allows players of all ages and backgrounds to
enjoy this style of game. This variation on guessr-type games would increase
exposure to a wide variety of diverse cultures and practices found on campus at
UIC, while providing a fun and engaging medium for its participants. The
combination of ease of accessibility, a zero-knowledge entry-barrier for
players, and the in-depth information on a diverse set of cultural practices
makes for an interesting, highly-engaging and enjoyable experience for a vast
online target audience. This project would contribute to increasing public
knowledge and awareness of many unique cultures and practices while providing a
fun and competitive user experience.

**Implementation 4:**
Users are prompted with photos of cultural events from UIC web pages and
forums, and are tasked with guessing the name of each featured cultural
event/practice by typing the answer into an interactive text field that is
preselected by their cursor for them to instantly begin typing in. The user
then submits their answer by pressing enter, and if the text field is empty
their submission is denied and the program will wait until they have submitted
a non-empty answer. After each guess, the user is met with a screen which tells
them whether their guess was correct or not, and exibits information about the
cultural event as well as the answer to the question. Similar to existing
implementations of guessr-type games such as geoguessr and foodguessr, this
game website tracks your score based on the accuracy of your guesses, and
grades you at the end of each round (rounds may contain around, for example,
7-10 questions each). Scores can be shared online, ranked on global
leaderboards, and compared with friends' scores. The backend would contain a
medium/large database containing images of cultural events from UIC websites
and forums, and each photo will have corresponding text and information about
the cultural event it depicts or captures. Player guesses may have a certain
level of flexibility for interpretation by the program, including
caps-insensitivity (ignoring capitalization of answers/submissions), acceptable
synonymous keywords in guesses (predetermined by the backend database), and
ignoring accidental double-spaces between words. Answers will be timed and
scores will be influenced by how quickly the user gives an answer for each
question/prompt. Best scores from each player will be recorded and featured on
a global leaderboard of up to some number of player scores (e.g. top 100 all
time, top 15 this week, top 10 scores from today, etc), encouraging competition
and increasing user engagement.

**Idea - Story - Inspiration 5:**
Many different cultures may have dietary restrictions.  One of the challenges Muslim Americans struggle with is finding halal food, especially in areas without many stores.  Given the lack of halal restaurants and the struggle to find them, it can be hard to find a place to eat.  Given that restaurants are often places people gather to find friends, it can be difficult to find other muslims to connect with.


**Implementation 5:**
A project to solve this issue would be a simple iOS/Android app (with a web version) that allows people to see halal restaurants.  Additionally, it can have an opt-in feature where you share your location with others, and ask if there are other users willing to meet up at the same restaurant to connect with each other.  In an attempt to help muslims reconnect with their culture, it can also have an informational page informing people about different types of halal options, and the history of islamic jurisprudence regarding the various types of halal options and methods.
 


# Idea Finalization

**From 5 project ideas you have above, please choose one of the project that you are going with for the rest of the semester. Explain why you are going with that project**

**Answer:**
The project we convened on tackling is Track 3 Idea 4: a cultural online "guessr" game, which uses photos from a large variety of events featured in UIC cultural centers as prompts for users to guess each photo's respective cultural context or event title.

## Database Design

**Q1: What database are you using for your project (SQLite, PostgreSQL, noSQL, MongoDB,...), and why do you choose it?**

**Answer:**
For our project, we will use PostgreSQL due to its robust and scalable nature.
PostgreSQL is ideal for leaderboards, tracking user progress, and relational
data between users/photos/guesses. PostgreSQL integrates well with Django, and
supports more advanced features like JSON fields for additional flexibility.
The main downsides to PostgreSQL include more setup overhead than something
like SQLite, and being heavier than something like MongoDB for purely
document-like storage. However, the benefits of PostgreSQL far outweigh the
downsides, making it the best overall choice for our project.

**Q2: How will database be helpful to your project? How will you design your database to support your application features?**

**Answer:** The database is crucial to our project because we need to
dynamically store and update user stats such as scores, high scores, session
timestamps, and leaderboards. It will also relate text data to images, since
this is how the app determines correct and incorrect answers to each prompt. To
support our application's features, we must design the database such that these
relational objects exist, and automatically update the leaderboards each time a
score is recorded, or the current date changes.

## Third-Party API Integration

**Q3: Which third-party API(s) will you integrate into your project? What data will you pull from the API(s), and how will you use it in your application?**

We plan on allowing users to create accounts on our website in order to streamline user registrations, and authentication we plan on using Django Allauth, a free and opensource API that manages account registrations, email verifications, forgotton password recovery, and sign ups through third-party social media, such as signing up with an google account. This will manage our email verifications for account creation on our website.    

**Q4: Does your API key has limitations such as rate limits or downtime? How are you going to deal with that?**

Full documentation for rate limits for django-allauth is located here:https://docs.allauth.org/en/latest/account/rate_limits.html 
In general rate limits are optional and can be disabled in django allauth, but we don't intend to do that as our rate limits exists as a security measure, for example thier is a rate limit of 5 password resets per user per minute or 10 failed logins per minute per ip address in order to prevent system abuse.  

## Authentication and Security

**Q5: What authentication method will you use (e.g., username/password, OAuth, JWT)?**

**Answer**  
We will use **email and password authentication** with passwords hashed (Argon2id or bcrypt). On login, users receive a **server-managed session** stored in a secure cookie (`HttpOnly`, `Secure`, `SameSite=Lax`) with CSRF protection enabled.  

**Q6: How will you store and protect sensitive user data (e.g., passwords, tokens)?**  

**Answer**  
We will **never store plaintext passwords**. All passwords are hashed with a salted algorithm (Argon2id/bcrypt). We will store only minimal PII (e.g., email), keep secrets in **environment variables**, enforce **HTTPS**, and apply basic rate-limiting and CSRF protection to prevent abuse.

## Deployment

**Q7: Where will you deploy your project (e.g., Heroku, AWS, Render)? How will you manage environment variables and secrets during deployment?**

**Q8: How will you ensure your deployment is reliable and easy to update?**
