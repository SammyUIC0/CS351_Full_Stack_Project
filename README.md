# Timeline: Weekly Meeting Goals  

**Q2:** What is your goals that your group want to achieve in each weekly meeting?  
**Example:**  
*Prior to 3/13: Weekly Meeting we will plan out some preliminary info/idea for the project itself ahead of the scheduled meeting like which data source/API and data structures we will use in our backend. We will browse [the given list of public APIs for inspiration](https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis).*  

*During week of 3/25: Work on the project rough draft itself to make a functioning project with data input, data structure usage, and processing into output on the frontend.*  

*Prior to 4/17: Meet together weekly to target project weakpoints/bugs and possibly visit office hours to get guidance if the progress feels weak.*  


**Answer**  
  
**Week of 9/22** – Hold an initial group meeting for introductions. Ensure all members have access to the GitHub repo and Figma collaboration space. Brainstorm project ideas (leaning toward Track 3 “Culture Guesser”). Split work to answer the MS2 questions in the README.  

**Prior to 10/02 (MS2 deadline)** – Meet at least once more to finalize group roles, confirm the project idea and scope, and complete/push all required MS2 questions to the GitHub repo (including extra credit).  

**Prior to MS4 Due Date** – Continue holding weekly meetings to check progress, surface and resolve bugs, and ensure everyone is aligned on responsibilities. Adjust timelines and redistribute tasks as needed.

# Communication  

**Q3a:** How can your group communicate when doing the Full Stack Group Project?  
**Q3b:** What are the usernames of each group member on that platform?  
**Q3c:** What is your group’s expected response time to messages?  

**Example:**  
*We will use Discord for communication*  

*Usernames:*  
*Justin - ghostmechanic*  
*Claudia - ninth.py*  
*Mauricio - itsperi*  
*Our expected response time will be within 12 hours.*

# Norms  

**Q4a:** How will your group handle situations when there is conflict in your group?  
**Answer:**
If a conflict arises for any reason, the first step is for each of us to take
turns during our meeting and respectfully explain our perspectives on the
situation in order to make sure we understand where each of us is coming from.
Then we can try to break down what happened and ask clarifying questions to
make sure we are all on the same page, and then from there we can try to figure
out a plan for how we can resolve the issue we are conflicted over.

Some helpful strategies to focus on include:
- Agreeing on roles and responsibilities, general and specific
- Making compromises on or dividing up work to acommodate the situation
- Preventing conflicts early on by setting clear goals for each group member and splitting work as evenly and consistently as possible

If the conflict hasn't yet been resolved after trying these strategies and a due date is approaching, we can bring it to a TA and explain the problem in a professional manner, and then use their advice as a plan to hopefully resolve the conflict in time for the deadline.

**Q4b:** How will your group handle situations when a member is not contributing enough?  

**Example:**  
*If there is a disagreement on direction, we will resolve it with a unanimous vote.*  
*If team members do not pull their weight, the team will politely remind them of their duties.*  
*If they continue to not pull their weight, then they will get another warning and a chance to start being more productive.*  

**Answer:**
The first and most effective approach would be any attempts to prevent this
from happening, such as checking in early with each other, and if a groupmate
seems to be falling behind on their task then the other groupmates can ask
what's wrong and if there's anything they can do to help or a way to change
responsibilites to better suit each other's needs.

It's important that when assigning group roles we are as specific as possible
about what exactly each person is implementing, rather than referring to our
roles as "backend" or "frontend".

If after this someone is still falling behind, we shouldn't assume laziness and
should ask what happened first. It's important to have a direct but respectfully
group conversation in order to channel strong communication between all group
members, and to stay factual and keep the conversation about work and fairness
instead of making anything personal.

Finally if this still hasn't worked to catch the person up to speed, bringing
in a TA can help to gain extra clarity and bring in a neutral-party's support
on the situation. This can help to solidify responsibilities between group
members, and to fairly and respecfully pressure any group member who has fallen
behind to catch up by better allowing them to understand their own
goals/responsibilites.

# Roles  

**Q5:** How will your group divide your role in the Group Project?  

**Example:**  
*Mauricio - Backend, Justin - Project Lead, Claudia - Frontend.*  

**Answer**  

**Conor — Project Lead** – Oversees coordination and project direction.  

**Sammy — Frontend** – Focuses on building the user interface and integrating designs from Figma.  

**Eric — Backend** – Responsible for setting up and maintaining the backend logic and APIs.  

**Note:** As mentioned in Question 4, our roles will extend beyond the typical front-end/back-end split, and each member will take on responsibilities that support the entire stack when necessary and roles are subject to change if necessary.

# Tech Stacks

**Q6:** Which tech stacks will your group use? (Django + React or Flask + React)
Django + React

# Full Stack Group Project Track  
---

# Track 1: Tackling Generative AI Consequences
**Problem 1:** 
AI podcasts are a rising concern with the rise of Genertaive Intellegence as they are easier to produce than AI video while still allowing for the generation of more misinformation than a single AI post.  

**Solution 1:** 
Creating a crowd source list of channels and accounts that are highly suspected to be AI generated. As well as a foroum where users can discuss media literacy in the age of generative AI.   

# Track 2: Technology for Public Goods 

**Problem 2:**

**Solution 2:** 
 

**Problem 3:** 
A lot of UIC students need to commute to UIC and MTA/CTA isn't accessable to them. And either can't afford or would rather carpool to UIC instead. 
**Solution 3:**  
A carpool website were UIC students can find other people create a carpool with, where the driver can set thier own availabilities and conditions. (Such as how to split gas-money, when to depart, ect).
