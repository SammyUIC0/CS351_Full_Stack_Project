# Timeline: Weekly Meeting Goals  

**Q2:** What is your goals that your group want to achieve in each weekly meeting?  
**Example:**  
*Prior to 3/13: Weekly Meeting we will plan out some preliminary info/idea for the project itself ahead of the scheduled meeting like which data source/API and data structures we will use in our backend. We will browse [the given list of public APIs for inspiration](https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis).*  

*During week of 3/25: Work on the project rough draft itself to make a functioning project with data input, data structure usage, and processing into output on the frontend.*  

*Prior to 4/17: Meet together weekly to target project weakpoints/bugs and possibly visit office hours to get guidance if the progress feels weak.*

# Norms  

**Q4a:** How will your group handle situations when there is conflict in your group?  
**Answer:**
If a conflict arises for any reason, the first step is for each of us to take
turns during our meeting and respectfully explain our perspectives on the
situation in order to make sure we understand where each of us is coming from.
Then we can try to break down what happened and ask clarifying questions to
make sure we are all on the same page, and then from there we can try to figure
out a plan for how we can resolve the issue we are conflicted over.

Some helpful strategies to focus on include:
- Agreeing on roles and responsibilities, general and specific
- Making compromises on or dividing up work to acommodate the situation
- Preventing conflicts early on by setting clear goals for each group member and splitting work as evenly and consistently as possible

If the conflict hasn't yet been resolved after trying these strategies and a due date is approaching, we can bring it to a TA and explain the problem in a professional manner, and then use their advice as a plan to hopefully resolve the conflict in time for the deadline.

**Q4b:** How will your group handle situations when a member is not contributing enough?  

**Example:**  
*If there is a disagreement on direction, we will resolve it with a unanimous vote.*  
*If team members do not pull their weight, the team will politely remind them of their duties.*  
*If they continue to not pull their weight, then they will get another warning and a chance to start being more productive.*  

**Answer:**
The first and most effective approach would be any attempts to prevent this
from happening, such as checking in early with each other, and if a groupmate
seems to be falling behind on their task then the other groupmates can ask
what's wrong and if there's anything they can do to help or a way to change
responsibilites to better suit each other's needs.

It's important that when assigning group roles we are as specific as possible
about what exactly each person is implementing, rather than referring to our
roles as "backend" or "frontend".

If after this someone is still falling behind, we shouldn't assume laziness and
should ask what happened first. It's important to have a direct but respectfully
group conversation in order to channel strong communication between all group
members, and to stay factual and keep the conversation about work and fairness
instead of making anything personal.

Finally if this still hasn't worked to catch the person up to speed, bringing
in a TA can help to gain extra clarity and bring in a neutral-party's support
on the situation. This can help to solidify responsibilities between group
members, and to fairly and respecfully pressure any group member who has fallen
behind to catch up by better allowing them to understand their own
goals/responsibilites.
